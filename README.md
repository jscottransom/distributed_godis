# Distributed Godis

The aim of this project is to develop a key-value store that leverages the power and intracacies of distributed systems. This means spinning up a cluster,
and having multiple servers react to requests accordingly. This ReadMe will be updated with the supporting workflow, examples, and benchmarks once complete.
